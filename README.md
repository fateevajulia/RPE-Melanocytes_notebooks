# üß¨ Evolutionary Homology Between RPE and Melanocytes

This repository is for the manuscript:

**"Melanocytes and photosensory organs share a common ancestry that illuminates the origins of the neural crest"**  
Yuliia Fatieieva, Rozalina Galimullina, Sergei Isaev, Alexander Klimovich, Laurence A. Lemaire and Igor Adameyko

We provide a multi-modal comparative analysis supporting the homology between neural crest-derived melanocytes and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Leveraging single-cell transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility, spatial gene expression, and evolutionary inference, we identify a conserved regulatory and transcriptional core tracing back to a photosensory ancestor.

## üî¨ Summary of Findings

- RPE and melanocytes share a deeply conserved gene regulatory and transcriptional program.
- Evolutionary tree reconstruction places them as closest relatives among pigment cell types.
- Ciona's pigmented ocellus expresses overlapping TFs with vertebrate RPE/melanocytes.
- Phylostratigraphy shows that melanocytes and RPE each gained new genes after they split from a common ancestor.
- The findings suggest that pigment cells in the neural crest evolved from an earlier photosensory cell type.

## üß† Biological Significance

Our study highlights a developmental and evolutionary link between melanocytes and RPE, two pigment-producing cell types previously thought to have arisen independently. This work supports a scenario in which pigment cells derive from ancestral photosensory lineages, with implications for the origin of the neural crest and evolution of sensory systems in chordates.
